title: "Explaining the URL"
---

The url of this website is a natural english sentence that uses / and - instead of spaces. It is highlighted on the top of the page and there it serves as a [breadcrumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_navigation) as well.

I had a precursor of this idea when I first heard of [this.is](https://this.is) in the early 2000s.
[this.is](https://this.is) is a website in the vain of geocities where people could obtain a subdomain e.g. [this.is/birgitta](https://this.is/birgitta). Although the site doesn't seem to be available, many of the subdomains still are.

Later, I had the idea of stucturing my website such that each page was a sentence like *Arnaldur is writing a compiler* or *Arnaldur is making a game*. Unfortunately, [Arnaldur.is](https://arnaldur.is) is taken and my namefellow[^1] wants to hold on to it. 

### African American Vernacular English
also known as [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English), is a dialect of english usually spoken by Americans of African descent. It has unfortunately received a bad reputation and is often considered to be ghetto speak or incorrect english. This is mostly inaccurate as AAVE has an internally consistent grammar and is better described as a dialect of english, rather than slang or other.

One of the most interesting aspects of AAVE is the so-called habitual be. In a sentence it goes: *he be working* or *they be hustlin'*. This would roughly translate to *he is in the habit of working* and *they are in the habit of hustling*. What is interesting is that this is unique to AAVE.

I looked at many of the available top level domains and noticed that the Arnaldur.is pun could be salvaged through the belgian domain `.be`.
I find the casuality of the habitual be even more relevant than *is* as the present tense doesn't apply to pages made in the past, i.e. I do what the url says occasionally, rather than currently but this is just a post-hoc rationalization.

There is some irony in the fact that AAVE is a really non-AAVE name for itself. But it's an interesting dialect and worth [checking out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English).

[^1]: Namefellow is a person who who has the same name as you. This word is rather obscure in english but the Icelandic translation nafni is commonly used due to [Icelandic naming laws](https://www.island.is/en/icelandic-names/).

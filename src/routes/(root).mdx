# Welcome
My name is Arnaldur and I am a Computer Scientist.

This is my abode on the internet.
I have written a few <u>[articles](/writing)</u> that you might want to read.

I'm currently looking for a full time job developing software.
Feel free to email me at <a href="a.arnaldur+be@gmail.com">a.arnaldur+be@gmail.com</a>.
The email does not have to be work related.

## The website

This website was made using [SolidStart](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start).
It is statically rendered, and hosted on AWS with the help of [SST](https://sst.dev/).
I use the beautiful and convenient [matcha.css](https://matcha.mizu.sh/) as a base for styling.

I have hidden an <i>easter egg</i> somewhere on the site.

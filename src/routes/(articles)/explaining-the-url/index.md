The url of this website and it's subdomains are natural english sentences that use / and - instead of spaces.
It is highlighted on the top of the page and there it serves as a [breadcrumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_navigation) as well.

I had a precursor of this idea when I first heard of [this.is](https://this.is) in the early 2000s.
[this.is](https://this.is) is a website in the vain of geocities where people could obtain a subdomain e.g. [this.is/birgitta](https://this.is/birgitta).

Later, I had the idea of stucturing my website such that each page was a sentence like _Arnaldur is writing a compiler_ or _Arnaldur is making a game_.
Unfortunately, [Arnaldur.is](https://arnaldur.is) is taken and my namefellow wants to hold on to it.
I has been unused for many years ðŸ¥²

Armed with this mediocre joke, I was looking for a domain for this website and stumbled upon `arnaldur.be`.
Unfortunately, the Belgians who decide the usage of their top level domain are liberal in their liscencing policies and let me lease the domain.

The joke works better in many ways when using the interesting [habitual _be_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_be) instead of _is_, whose tense is more present.

This is the *easter egg* mentioned on the front page.

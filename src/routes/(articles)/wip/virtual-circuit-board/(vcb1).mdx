# VCB: Designing a Fast Bespoke Adder

I stumbled upon a beautiful program called [Virtual Circuit board](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885690/Virtual_Circuit_Board/) (VCB) some time ago.
It resonated with my soft spot for vibrant colors, minimalist aesthetics, and the subject of computing.

Some years prior I *played* the game [NandGame](https://nandgame.com/) which tought me how to build a computer from simple logic gate primitives.
The simplicity of the task had me surprised, as although I have been computer savy all my life, I perceived the inner workings of a computer to be some complex dark magic.

## The Challenge

After a quick "It can't be that hard", I decided to challenge myself to make a **RETROACTIVELY CHOSEN GAME** from memory, and from scratch, using Virtual Circuit Board. 
Importantly, _I can't reference any sources to aid me with the task_.

## Virtual Circuit Board

In this video you can see the elementary behavior of VCB.
- Latches, logic gates, and more are called components.
- A single component can comprise many units of the same type, and all the connected units act as one.
- Components are connected by traces via read and write elements (marked as `R` and `W`).
- There is a single tick delay between a read element lighting up and it's connected component activating.
- The trace colors are mostly cosmetic, so touching traces of any color are considered connected.
- The hollow cross is an element that lets traces cross without connecting.
- Components are updated once per tick

This circuit model is straight forward, although I believe it to be unlike typical physical circuits.
The biggest difference being that signals propagate infinitely fast along traces and within components.
The lock step nature of the tick model means that the latency of a logic design can be measured in ticks.

To aid with modularity, I decided that all my designs would have these properties:
- The design has a delay of $d$ ticks.
- A single tick input signal will cause a single tick output signal after $d$ ticks.
- No input signal can affect another signal that was input at a different time.
- A sequence of inputs therefore produces a delayed sequence of correct outputs.

These constraints seemed fairly obvious and I suspect that designs that don't follow these rules 
are much harder to work with.

### Adders

I started by designing logic to add numbers.
![Adders](./2-1-adders.avif)
I'll emphasize it once again, I'm still under the self-imposed information embargo.
I think the design on the left is known as a half-adder, and the one on the right, a full-adder.
I don't know this for sure, and I can't look it up yet.
These are in any case designs I discovered were needed to add binary numbers.

Notice that there are three disconnected and gates on the full adder connected to the same trace.
As the trace is activated when any component writes to it, this design functions as a zero-delay or gate.
I use this trick a lot, although it is susceptible to an issue where the signal flows in the wrong direction.

![4-bit adders](./2-2-4-bit-adders.avif)
These are both four bit adders. The left one only uses half-adders and the right one, full-adders.
The green elements with a play icon on them are one-tick delays that ensure a synchronized signal propagation.
Both of these designs have a four tick delay due to the most significant bit (cyan trace)
having a dependency on the least significant bit (orange trace).

When extending (and compacting) the right design to eight bits:
![8-bit adders](./2-3-8-bit-adder.avif)
I realized that the time complexity of the design was $O(b)$ where $b$ is the number of bits.
This was surprising, as I had always thought it was a constant time operation.
Addition is a fast operation in real world CPUs and I look forward to learning if it really is $O(b)$,
it's a quirk of VCB, or if real CPUs use other faster designs.

The red, green, and blue elements with lightning symbols on them are busses.
Busses let you bundle differently colored traces together, facilitating more compact designs.

#### A Faster Adder

I found the time complexity unsatisfying, so I set out to design a faster adder.
The bottleneck of the current design was that each adder needed the output of the previous one.
Each output was just one bit of information, or just one of two options.
I had the idea of having two adders for the four <abbr data-title="Most significant bits">MSB</abbr>.
Each would assume it received one of the two possible outputs,
and their output would be gated by the actual output when it was available.
![faster adder](./2-4-faster-adder.avif)
Each trace color represents a bit of a given significance. 
The <abbr data-title="These are all in-game color names">yellow</abbr>
trace is the least significant, and the purple carry bit in the top left is the most significant.
Notice how the turquoise bit from the right 4-bit adder controls the outputs of the two leftmost adders via and gates.

This design added 8 bits on only 6 ticks. 4 ticks for the adders and 2 ticks for the output gate.
The only reason the output gate needed two ticks was the single red not gate, controlling the left outputs.
This gate was controlled by the output of three and gates, or-ed together using the zero-delay trick.
<abbr data-title="Don't ask my how I remembered this">De-morgan's rules</abbr>
state that $\lnot(a \land b \land c) = \lnot a \lor \lnot b \lor \lnot c$.
VCB has a nor gate with that exact behavior.

Here is a video of the 5 tick design, incorporating the idea.

import vid2 from "./2-5-faster-adder.webm";

<video controls loop preload="metadata">
    <source src={vid2} type="video/webm" />
</video>
The video depicts the design going through an exhaustive test, adding all combinations of 8-bit integers.
I speed up the simulation to a point where non-trivial values are being added,
and slow it down there such that the signal propagation is clearly visible.
I then speed it up again until the test is over, triggering a breakpoint.
A second test cycle is started when the breakpoint triggers and the video ends.

Notice the turquoise trace, activated by the aforementioned nor gates at the start of the video.
This small change let me remove a whole row of delays, reducing the latency of the design to 5 ticks.

#### Logarithmic Adder

If an 8-bit adder can be split into three 4-bit adders.
It stands to reason that a 4-bit adder can be split into three 2-bit adders the same way. And a 2-bit into to 1-bit.

I decided to try that, and here is the evolution of the design:
![log adders](./2-6-log-adders-2.avif)

To my disappointment, the final design only reduced the latency by one tick, down to four.
I realize now that splitting the 4-bit adders improved the speed but splitting the 2-bit adders did not,
as a 2-bit adder already has a two tick latency.
The design can easily be generalized to 16 bits which would only add one tick of latency but would triple the footprint.
It's latency is $\log_2(b)$ ticks, while the footprint is $O(\log_2(b) b^{\log_2(3)})$. 
I was surprised to encounter a logarithm when designing an adder, but when working with binary, $\log_2(x)$ is never far away.

Although VCB has a fairly large canvas, I had already made created some repeating designs that filled a significant portion of the canvas.
These were low latency lookup tables that displayed 8-bit signed integers on a 7 segment display. See if you can spot them:
![canvas](./2-7-canvas.avif)
Because of this, I tried to make all my designs as compact as possible,
without sacrificing structure too much, i.e. repeating patterns should be fairly obvious.

Here is the final logarithmic-latency adder:
![log adder](./2-8-log-adder.avif)

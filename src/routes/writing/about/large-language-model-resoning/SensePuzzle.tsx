        <summary>When I forbade that, It came up with this hilariously easy puzzle.</summary>
        <h3>The Puzzle:</h3>
        <p>
          You are in a room with three people: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Each of
          them can see and hear normally. You place a different object in front of
          each person: a red ball in front of Alice, a blue ball in front of Bob,
          and a green ball in front of Charlie.
        </p>
        <p>You then ask each person a simple question:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You ask Alice, "What color is the ball in front of you?"</li>
          <li>You ask Bob, "What color is the ball in front of you?"</li>
          <li>You ask Charlie, "What color is the ball in front of you?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each person gives a truthful response:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Alice says, "The ball in front of me is red."</li>
          <li>Bob says, "The ball in front of me is blue."</li>
          <li>Charlie says, "The ball in front of me is green."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Finally, you ask a bystander who can see and hear everything in the
          room, "What color is the ball in front of Alice?"
        </p>
        <p>What color is the ball in front of Alice?</p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
          To solve this puzzle, you need to realize that the people in the puzzle
          have functioning senses (sight) and are giving direct observations based
          on what they see. The solution is immediately apparent by simply
          believing their direct observations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Conclusion</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The ball in front of Alice is red.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The puzzle is resolved by understanding that Alice, Bob, and Charlie
          have functioning senses and are correctly identifying the colors of the
          balls in front of them based on what they can see. No further logical
          deduction or higher-order thinking is required.

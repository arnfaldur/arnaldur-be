# Large Language Model Reasoning

There is an idea floating around, which has some traction, that LLM intelligence
is illusory. LLMs are an impressive piece of technology, capable of generating
text of higher quality than an average person. As is common---when the magic
wears off and the initial hype dies down---a counter culture forms around the
best ideas of cynics, skeptics, and those who were never impressed. 

## _Just_ a next-token predictor

[Search for "token predictor" on X for context](https://x.com/search?q=token%20predictor).

LLMs are \'_just_ a next-token predictor\'. The only problem with this phrasing is the implication of the use of the word \'_just_\'.
Architecturally speaking, LLMs are designed to estimate the probabilities of tokens, making them next-token predictors as a matter of fact. 
That is no small feat, however. The implication is that they can't possess real intelligence.

Let's consider a hypothetical situation in the year 2000. A group of people receive funding to create an API that performs next-token prediction.
The tokens predicted by the API should be, above all else, as human-like as possible.
It can come at the cost of high latency and low throughput.
The group would look into the state of the art in natural language processing research and find that we had some ways to go.
Ultimately, the best solution would be to place humans behind the API. They hire people to man the API and create a system to divvy up the prediction tasks.

This API would be expensive and slow, but it is a next-token predictor, you might even say that it is _just_ a next-token predictor.
If we control for the latency of the API, there is no way to tell what process is behind it, similar to modern LLMs.

The humans behind the API possess real intelligence and by extension, so does the API.
Therefore, the intelligence implication falls apart, as something being a next-token predictor doesn't preclude it from possessing real intelligence.

There are [pitfalls with next-token prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06963), but they are issues with the interface to the intelligence, not the nature of it.

## Incapable of reasoning or thought

This was a part of a discussion about ChatGPT being unable to identify the number of sides of a regular polygon.
It was off by one most of the time---calling heptagons octagons, or hexagons---and couldn't reliably correct itself.
I'll get to the particulars of this case later, but we start broadly.

LLMs can reason but their architecture limits their capacity for contemplation.
All the thoughts required to obtain an answer to a question must happen in one forward pass of the neural network.
If the LLM isn't smart enough to think of the right answer in one go, it has committed to a token that contains, or leads to an incorrect answer.

[Chain of thought (CoT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916 "arXiv:[2205.11916] Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners") prompting mitigates this problem to a degree. 
The intuition is that CoT gives the LLM space to generate tokens that don't commit to a final answer, but can contain information than can steer the LLM towards the correct answer. 
It also has the potential to increase the amount of useful ideas the critical tokens can attend to, via the attention mechanism.

[Tree of thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601 "arXiv:[2305.10601] Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models") and [LLM adapted Beam search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00633 "arXiv:[2305.00633] Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search for Reasoning") improve on these ideas further, by letting the LLM explore multiple trains of thought and reducing commitments to specific tokens.

### It only goes so deep
LLMs have a pre-specified depth. There has been some research that suggests that [Not all Layers of LLMs are Necessary during Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02181 "arXiv:[2403.02181] Not all Layers of LLMs are Necessary during Inference").
Easier tasks are often solved in the first layers, while harder ones use the entire depth of the model.
[ConsistentEE](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29922 "ConsistentEE: A Consistent and Hardness-Guided Early Exiting Method for Accelerating Language Models Inference") explores the idea of training a model with early exiting logic built in, reducing inference cost.

### The token constraint
Even with this freedom, an LLM still finds its thoughts heavily constrained.
It must ultimately wrap up every thought into a single token that must be grammatically sound.
This is likely a bottleneck to the internal thought patterns.

To make a human analogy: consider Joe, Joe looses all short term memory every 8 seconds.
He has to project all his thoughts onto some medium, like a notepad or a computer, following strict formatting rules, before he forgets.
Incorporating the KV cache into the analogy: although Joe looses his train of thought periodically, he will recall encountered ideas when retreading previous thoughts.
I think most people would find this constraint difficult, but this is the framework LLMs work within.
I don't mean to imply that without these constraints, LLMs were more intelligent.
The framework constrains their intelligence, but is also the means by which they are intelligent.

[DeepMind's MuZero](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules/ "DeepMind blog: MuZero: Mastering Go, chess, shogi and Atari without rules") sought to resolve an analogous problem.
Its predecessor, [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/ "DeepMind blog: AlphaZero: Shedding new light on chess, shogi, and Go") generated a distribution over legal moves and a win percentage estimate for the current position.
Similarly to an LLM condensing its thoughts into a token, AlphaZero had to condense all its thoughts into the legal move distribution. 
If either gleamed insight that will be relevant a few steps into the future, they must rediscover it at the moment it can be cemented into a token or a certain move. The attention mechanism alleviates this problem to a degree
MuZero solved this by replacing the board positions (resulting from the proposed moves) with a _hidden state_ that it can learn to encode arbitrary ideas within.

It would be interesting to research applying the same idea to LLMs.
A simple implementation could include passing the pre-logit embeddings back into the LLM, after the token embedding layer, and increasing the d_model size, while reserving some of the added dimensions for the recurrence. 
Removing the one-to-one constraint between tokens and forward passes is another prospect.
[Let's Think Dot by Dot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15758 "arXiv:[2404.15758] Let's Think Dot by Dot: Hidden Computation in Transformer Language Models") explores this idea.

Ease of training has played a significant role in the success of the transformer architecture. 
These ideas loose a lot of that due to their RNN inspired properties---as the chain of dots paper touches on. It might not be practical, but that hypothesis is worth falsifying.

Þarf að endurhugsa mikið af þessu. Mikið af hugsunum (kanski allar?) transformera eru geymdar í KV cacheinu.

LLMs are limited in their capacity for contemplation. Their ideas must be
squeezed through the tokenizer to be retreivable again in the next iteration of
thought via methods like chain of thought reasoning. That internal dialogue is
constrained by the grammatical correctness of language which likely limits the
expressivity of the thoughts.

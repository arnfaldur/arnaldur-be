# An n-ball Between n-balls
There is a geometric thought experiment that is often used to demonstrate the counterintuitive shape of high-dimensional phenomena. This article is an interactive visual journey into the construct in the thought experiment, and the mathematics behind it.

## A Square with Four Circles
We start with a $$4 \times 4$$ square. There are four blue circles, with a radius of one, packed into the box. One in each corner.
At the center of the box is a red circle. The red circle is as large as it can be, without overlapping the blue circles.
Drag the slider to add a third dimension.
On this and all other 3D diagrams, you can drag the image to rotate it, and scroll to zoom.

import { Diagram1 } from "./diagrams/Diagram1";

When extending the construct to 3D, many things happen.
All the circles are now spheres, the red sphere is larger while the blue spheres aren't,
and there are eight spheres while there were only four circles.

The dimensional extension is decomposed into three phases.
First, the circles and square turn into spheres and a cube.
Next, the central ball grows, and everything else shifts so that it ends in the center.
Finally, four new spheres appear, completing the 3D version of the construct.

### Defining the Construct
There are more than one way to extend the construct into higher dimensions, so to make it more rigorous, we will define it like so:
An $$n$$-dimensional version of the construct consists of an $$n$$-cube with a side length of $$4$$.
On the midpoint between each vertex and the center of the $$n$$-cube, there is an $$n$$-ball with a radius of one.
In the center of the $$n$$-cube there is the largest $$n$$-ball that does not intersect any other $$n$$-ball.

## Building Intuitions
We want to extend it into any amount of dimensions but before that, we'll build some intuitions.

### 2D Intersection of 3D Construct

import { Diagram2, Former, Latter } from "./diagrams/Diagram2";

In the default configuration, the intersecting plane is the same as the construct in 2D.
We see that when we rotate the plane along the center of the left balls, the balls on the right, vanish and are replaced---within the plane---by the two balls, diagonally across.
There are a few important behaviors to note from this interactable.

1. When the red ball migrates from the 2D center to the 3D center, it shrinks and vanishes from the 2D plane.
2. As seen in the isolate plane perspective, the left balls maintain their size and only shift slightly away from the center.
3. The differences between the <Former/> and <Latter/> configuration.
    1. The enclosing box's width grows from $$4$$ to $$4\sqrt{2}$$.
    2. Similarly, the balls' horizontal positions shift from $$\pm 1$$ to $$\pm \sqrt{2}$$
    3. The red ball's radius grows from $$\sqrt{2} - 1$$ to $$\sqrt{3} - 1$$

### 1D Intersection of 3D Construct
import { Diagram3 } from "./diagrams/Diagram3";

<Diagram3 />

This diagram demonstrates the same phenomena as before, except the intersection is one dimensional and diagonalizes first into two, then three dimensions.
Notice the similarities between the previous two diagrams.
The left *ball* shifts to the left, maintaining it's size, while the right ball vanishes to be replaced by another farther away.

Now we perform the same diagonalization operation, starting from three dimensions.
As visualizing higher dimensions is not intuitive, we can't rely on a lower dimensional intersection of a higher dimensional object to guide us.
The similarities should be evident however.

### 3D Intersection of 10D Construct
import { Diagram4 } from "./diagrams/Diagram4";

<Diagram4 />

it's not spiky, here's why...

show a 3D diagonal slice through a 4D construct, compressing 2 dimensions into 1. Then a 3D diagonal through 5D construct, compressing 3 dimensions into 1.

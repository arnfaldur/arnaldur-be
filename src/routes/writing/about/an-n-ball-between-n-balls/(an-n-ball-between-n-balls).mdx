# An n-ball between n-balls

There is a geometric thought experiment that is often used to demonstrate the counterintuitive shape of high-dimensional phenomena. This article is an interactive visual journey into the construction in the thought experiment, and the mathematics behind it.

## A square with Four Circles

We start with a $$4 \times 4$$ square. There are four blue circles, with a radius of one, packed into the box. One in each corner.
At the center of the box is a red circle. The red circle is as large as it can be, without overlapping the blue circles.

Drag the slider to add a third dimension.
On this and all other 3D diagrams, you can drag the image to rotate it, and scroll to zoom.

When extending the construction to 3D, many things happen.
All the circles are now spheres, the red sphere is larger while the blue spheres aren't,
and there are eight spheres while there were only four circles.

There are more than one way to extend the construction into higher dimensions, so to make it more rigorous, we will define it like so:
An $$n$$-dimensional version of the construction consists of an $$n$$-cube with a side length of $$4$$.
On the midpoint between each vertex and the center of the $$n$$-cube, there is an $$n$$-ball with a radius of one.
In the center of the $$n$$-cube there is the largest $$n$$-ball that does not intersect any other $$n$$-ball.

With that out of the way, we can break the dimension extension into smaller pieces.

# An n-ball between n-balls

There is a geometric thought experiment that is often used to demonstrate the counterintuitive shape of high-dimensional phenomena. This article is an interactive visual journey into the construction in the thought experiment, and the mathematics behind it.

## A square with Four Circles

We start with a $$4 \times 4$$ square. For each of the four corners, there is a unit circle (colored blue) that is both fully contained within the box, and positioned at the point closest to the corner.

At the center of the box is the largest circle (colored red) that doesn't intersect with any of the corner circles.
The red circle touches all the corner circles.
